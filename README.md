### Who am i?
Hey everyone im Chris, your more or less typical IT guy.
I started my journey with a absolut detest for programming.

Until one day i had to code, that was the moment i fell in love with it.
That was also the moment i realized something about myself.
Im really, really really, (really!) bad with typical tutorials or courses and am way better at just "starting".

That being said i, for a while now, procrastinate learning javascript.<br>The simple reason being that im more of a backend or middleware kind of guy and that is where my fascination lies.<br>Also and probaply more importantly i always have found a way "around" it, lets hope very soon a project comes along where i cant outrun my procrastination. :shrug:.<br><br>The language where im most comfortable at is Python, simply bc thats the language i used the most (u get just used to things, u know?).
<br>Another topic i love to dive into is the devops world. Including but not limited to Ansible  & Terraform deployment technologies.<br>Or basically anything with containerization now that i thnk about it ðŸ‘€.<br><br><br>


### Current Projects

My current larger projects include a selfservice Portals and Enterprise Scheduler.
The Tech-Stack currently relies heavily on [https://github.com/temporalio](temporal)


### Contact

#### ðŸ“« How to reach me?<br> > > > Well basically just hit me up on twitter or here on GH.
