Hey everyone im Chris, your more or less typical IT guy.
I started my journey with a absolut detest for programming.

Until one day i had to code, that was the moment i fell in love with.
That was also the moment i realized something about myself.
Im really, really really, (really!) bad with typical tutorials or courses and am way better at just "starting".

That being said i, for a while now, procrastinate learning javascript.
The simple reason being that im more of a backend or middleware kind of guy and that is where my fascination lies.
Also and probaply more importantly i always have found a way "around" it, lets hope very soon a project comes along where i cant outrun my procrastination. :shrug:

The language where im most comfortable at is Python, simply bc thats the language i used the most (u get just used to things, u know?).
Another topic i love to dive into is the devops world. Including but not limited to Ansible  & Terraform deployment technologies.
Or basically anything with containerization now that i thnk about it ðŸ‘€.<br><br><br><img src="https://i.redd.it/ecbal885xmm61.png" width="300" /><br>![source](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/m3mwcu/devops_is_a_culture_not_a_role/)<br><br><br>


ðŸ“« How to reach me: Well basically just hit me up on twitter or here on GH.


Still here? Oh wow...<br>thats the end of the doc... <br>No, really...<br>fine... i promise to get into Javascript, deal?<br><br>
K, Bye then :wave:
